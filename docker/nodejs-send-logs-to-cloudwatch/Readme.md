# NodeJS app that sends logs to AWS CloudWatch

This is a very simple NodeJS app that listens on port 3000 (mapped locally on port 49160 but you can change it) and sends its logs to AWS CloudWatch

## Installation

1. Download the code from this repo
2. Rename env_template to .env
3. Customize .env with the information necessary to the NodeJS app to log events into CloudWatch
4. run docker build and docker run to start the application

```bash
docker build -t node_send_logs_to_cloudwatch .
docker run -p 49160:3000 -d node_send_logs_to_cloudwatch
```

5. Open your browser and access to http://localhost:49160
6. Look in your AWS account to the CloudWatch log group you configured in the environment file. You should see a new stream and, inside it, a new log generated by the app
